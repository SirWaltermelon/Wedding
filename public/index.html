                    <p>So there's this lady named Jessica</p>
                    <p> She's an accomplished at home baker, brunch aficionado, and part time dog walker (not currently taking on new clients).
                        She enjoys saying she likes to spend time outdoors when really she's only interested if it involves craft beer and a nice patio (bonus points 
                        if there are snacks). Sometimes she has false confidence and convinces herself to run half marathons but most days shes's happy doing pretty much nothing at all.

                    <h1 class="text-center">About the Groom</h1>
                    <p>Let me tell you about this guy Joe.</p>
                   
                    <p>There's not too much to say really. He works in IT which means he can probably fix your computer
                        even though he doesn't necessarily want to. If he had it his way he would spend most of his time playing/streaming video games to 
                        his incredible audience of no one. He's rather quiet when it comes to conversation but if you heard what he was saying in his head you 
                        would think otherwise. He also made this website so please keep comments to a minimum or he'll obsess on trying to get it fixed</p>

                    <h1 class="text-center">Our story or something like that</h1>
                    <p>It all started with a text.</p>
                      <p>While both at a sleep over with friends around Christmas time in 2011 with people we mostly no longer talk to 
                        (hi people we don’t talk to, nice to see you’re doing well) one prank phone call led to another which then resulted
                        in us exchanging numbers. Since that night we have never been out of contact for more than a few days. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>After nearly 10 years of being together and experiencing the ups and downs of going through a 
                            relationship: graduating high school, college, first jobs and apartments, moving to a different state,
                             moving BACK, buying a first home and our biggest test yet - getting a dog 
                             <a id="yosh" href="images/yosh.jpeg" data-lightbox="yosh" class="text-white">(see Yoshi)</a>
                             we decided it was time to seal the deal. </p>
                        <br>                      
                        <p>As neither of us are big on being in the spotlight, we always knew we would likely elope
                             at a courthouse just the two of us and keep things simple. 
                             (Also can we talk about how insane weddings actually are? 
                             Why should WE throw a party for YOU to celebrate US? Okay- not the time
                              but I really think we should evaluate this) </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the interest of not being totally hated by family and friends for not involving 
                            them in our day we had some pictures taken to capture and commemorate it.</p>
